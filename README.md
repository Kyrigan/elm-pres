Hey, this is a simple template for making elm presentations, designed for you guys taking
COMPSCI 1JC3 at McMaster University. Hopefully this will speed up the process significantly!

I'm also including my original presentation from when I took the course (updated so it works in
Elm 0.17, hopefully it gives you some inspiration.)
